# Clinician-in-the-Loop Decision Making: Reinforcement Learning with Near-Optimal Set-Valued Policies
Source code submission for ICML 2020

## Notes
- The implementation of the main algorithms can be found under `synthetic/lib`
- Run notebooks in `synthetic` to recreate all synthetic experiments (Figures 1-5)
- Follow instructions in `mimic-sepsis` to recreate the real data experiment (Figure 6-7)
